 # Skills showcased in this Project

- Data Extraction
- Data Cleaning
- Data Transformation
- Data Visualization


# DATA SOURCING

- Data Extraction: Initially, we retrieved the sales data from the provided CSV files. This involved accessing the files containing the relevant sales information.


- Data Cleaning: Verified data types including dates and times.Filtered out non-'options' text rows and irrelevant columns.Processed salary ranges by splitting values, calculating averages, and removing unwanted columns for streamlined analysis.


- Data Transformation: Using Power BI's Power Query editor, we performed transformations and cleaning operations on the raw data. This step involved tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and formatting data types to ensure consistency and accuracy.


- Data Loading into Power BI: After the transformation process, the refined data was loaded into Power BI for visualization and analysis. This step involved importing the cleaned data into Power BI's data model, where it could be easily accessed and utilized for creating insightful visualizations and reports.


# Project Learnings:
  
- Built a dashboard to visualize the dataset, connecting it for interactive exploration.

  
- Cleaned the dataset, removing duplicates for data integrity.

  
- Sorted and created new columns, removing unnecessary ones for clarity.

  
- Categorized data professionals (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Engineer) using if functions for standardized formatting, aiding visualization.

  
- Implemented gauges for quick summaries of happiness with work/life balance and salary satisfaction.

  
- Developed clustered bar charts to calculate average salaries across various data fields, facilitating comparative analysis and insights.
